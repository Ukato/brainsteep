      <h1>Welcome to Brainsteep</h1>
      <h2>A SITE DEDICATED TO TEA AND THOUGHT</h2>
      <p>You're probably thinking, "Oh, what's this? They're going to describe this site at the get-go, without making me scroll to the bottom or click on another page?" Yep, weird, we know.  We've always found it annoying that most sites make you work to figure them out.  Not this one!  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Here at Brainsteep, *hint* *hint*, we focus on two simple topics: tea and philosophy.  That's it. Done.</p>
      <p>OK, on second thought, those two topics are anything but simple.  <em>Yes, I purposely used the word "simple" so I could recant it two sentences later, but I digress as I'm trying to introduce you to this site and not scare you away with a meta commentary on my writing style...like I'm doing right now...Sorry.</em></p>
      <p>In fact, both tea and philosophy are so diverse and intricate, one could probably create some sort of website dedicated to them.  It could have articles written by a group of passionate people.  It could maybe even have a podcast where those people get together, drink tea, and philosophize the hell outta something.  Maybe call it Brainsteep, idunno.  Heck, why not add a section for information about live events held with readers/listeners in virtual reality!  Well, surprise, that's this site! <strong>Hello, and welcome to Brainsteep.</strong></p>

        <p>If you're someone who already gets why one would write at length on the subject of tea, click on the button below and move on with your tea filled life!  To those that are still here, you may be confused.  We're here to help you understand the rabbit hole that is <em>camellia sinensis</em>.  Yeah, that's right, we just pulled out the scientific name for tea.  It's a single plant people!  We bet you didn't even know there are six general types of tea based on how that single plant is processed by human and machine hands!  God, we envy your ignorance on the subject.  Well, now that we've obviously intrigued you to learn more, quickly, click the button below! The know-it-all tea guru that started reading this same paragraph has already moved on and started reading! You don't want to be the only tea dunce in the world unable to tell the difference between a Taiwanese oolong and Japanese Kukicha do you? Exactly.</p>

        <h2>Articles about philosophy?</h2>
        <h3>less academic journal, more psychedelic trip rant</h3>
        <p>So, it's here that we want to demystify the word philosophy.  To some the word conjurs forth the most pedantic of professors, the most arogant of aristocrats, and the most how-to-do-ist sons-a-bitches. I'm working on that last one.  That's not us.  I mean, I guess you'll be the decider of that, but we don't count ourselves among their ranks at least in our minds.  Everyone is a philosopher in one way or another, and everyone has a philosophy when it comes to "X". X being a stand-in for life, living, work, relationships, society, government, morals, food, hobbies, nature, music, and on and on and on.  We're here to share our thoughts on a huge range of topics as they come up and as we're prompted by what we've seen, heard, or read.  We hope you'll enjoy at least something we've written, but the only guarantee we can give is you'll almost certainly find something you don't like.</p>

        <p>Yep, we make a podcast too, because we didn't think assaulting your eyes was enough.  Brainsteep is the bastard child of a long forgotten cup of sheng puerh and the endless debate over what a sandwich is.  Your ears are going to bleed from the knowledge exposure.</p>
